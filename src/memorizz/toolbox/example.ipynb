    "### Function Registration and Discovery\n",
    "- **Registration**: Convert Python functions into LLM-callable tools with semantic metadata\n",
    "- **Vector Embeddings**: Index tools for efficient semantic retrieval based on natural language queries\n",
    "- **Discoverability**: Find relevant tools based on contextual requirements without explicit references \n",
    "- **Persistence**: Store tool definitions across sessions and application restarts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Management\n",
    "- **Centralized Repository**: Maintain all tools in a single, organized collection\n",
    "- **Access Control**: Configure private or global tool access patterns for agents\n",
    "- **Tool Metadata**: Enhance functions with rich descriptions and usage examples\n",
    "- **Versioning**: Update tool implementations while maintaining consistent identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Integration\n",
    "- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Agents can discover and utilize the most relevant tools for each query\n",
    "- **Contextual Relevance**: Tools are matched to queries based on semantic similarity\n",
    "- **Automatic Documentation**: Generate parameter schemas and usage instructions for LLMs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manage missing or broken tool implementations\n",

    "1. Analyzes function signatures and docstrings to extract parameter information\n",
    "2. Generates embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of each tool\n",
    "3. Stores both the metadata and function references in the memory provider\n",
    "4. Provides retrieval mechanisms for both exact and similarity-based lookups\n",

    "#### Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- A tool added via the `add_tool` method to the MemAgent will be located in the `tools` attribute of the agent itself. This approach ensures each agent maintains its own isolated tool registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A copy of the tool in the toolbox is made and stored within the MemAgent, preserving the tool's metadata, schema, and function reference. This design prevents cross-agent contamination when tool implementations are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods such as `refresh_tools(tool_id)` allow you to update specific tools within an agent when their implementations change in the source toolbox. This ensures agents can receive tool updates without complete reconfiguration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `tool_access` attribute determines how tools are discovered during agent execution:\n",
    "  - When set to `\"private\"` (default), agents only access tools explicitly added to them\n",
    "  - When set to `\"global\"`, agents can dynamically discover any tool in the toolbox based on query relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent maintains a private map of `tool_id → python_function` references in the `_tool_functions` attribute, ensuring function calls are properly directed to their implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When an agent is persisted via `save()`, tool references are stored in the database, making them available after application restarts or when loading agents on different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tools with missing implementations are gracefully handled during agent execution with informative error messages rather than runtime failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can inspect an agent's available tools using the native `list_tools()` method inherited from the toolbox interface.\n",
    "\n",
